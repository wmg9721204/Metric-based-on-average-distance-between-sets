## Metric based on average distance between sets

The code in this repository is based on the formula in the follwing arXiv paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1049

In particular, please refer to Equation (3.1) in Theorem 3. 

Note that the formula is modified by squaring the distances, so that the resulting 'metric' is featurewise additive (i.e. summing 'metric' featurewise is equivalent to computing the 'metric' with respect to all features).
